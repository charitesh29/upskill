True or False: Loading data into Snowflake requires that source data files be no larger than 16MB.
A. True
B. False
Answer: B
Explanation:
By default, COPY INTO location statements separate table data into a set of output files to take advantage of parallel operations. The maximum size for each file is set using the MAX_FILE_SIZE copy option. 
The default value is 16777216 (16 MB) but can be increased to accommodate larger files. The maximum file size supported is 5 GB for Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure stages. 
To unload data to a single output file (at the potential cost of decreased performance), specify the SINGLE = true copy option in your statement. You can optionally specify a name for the file in the path.

What happens when a cloned table is replicated to a secondary database? (Select TWO)
A. A read-only copy of the cloned tables is stored.
B. The replication will not be successful.
C. The physical data is replicated
D. Additional costs for storage are charged to a secondary account
E. Metadata pointers to cloned tables are replicated
Answer: C, D
Explanation:
Cloned objects are replicated physically rather than logically to secondary databases. That is, cloned tables in a standard database do not contribute to the overall data storage unless or until DML
operations on the clone add to or modify existing data. However, when a cloned table is replicated to a secondary database, the physical data is also replicated, increasing the data storage usage for your account.

Which data types does Snowflake support when querying semi-structured data? (Select TWO)
A. VARIANT
B. ARRAY
C. VARCHAR
D. XML
E. BLOB
Answer: A, B
Explanation:
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/semistructured-intro.html#label-loading-semistructured-data
A VARIANT stores semi-structured data in Snowflake. It can store a value of any other type, including
OBJECT and ARRAY.
The maximum length of a VARIANT is 16 MB.
A Snowflake ARRAY is similar to an array in many other programming languages. An ARRAY contains
0 or more pieces of data. Each element is accessed by specifying its position in the array.

A user is loading JSON documents composed of a huge array containing multiple records into Snowflake. The user enables the strip__outer_array file format option
What does the STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY file format do?
A. It removes the last element of the outer array.
B. It removes the outer array structure and loads the records into separate table rows,
C. It removes the trailing spaces in the last element of the outer array and loads the records into separate table columns
D. It removes the NULL elements from the JSON object eliminating invalid data and enables the ability to load the records
Answer: B
Explanation:
Data Size Limitations
The VARIANT data type imposes a 16 MB size limit on individual rows.
For some semi-structured data formats (e.g. JSON), data sets are frequently a simple concatenation of multiple documents. The JSON output from some software is composed of a single huge array
containing multiple records. There is no need to separate the documents with line breaks or commas, though both are supported.
If the data exceeds 16 MB, enable the STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY file format option for the COPY INTO <table> command to remove the outer array structure and load the records into separate table rows:
copy into <table>
from @~/<file>.json
file_format = (type = 'JSON' strip_outer_array = true);

A. Create the custom role using the SYSADMIN role.
B. Assign the custom role to the SYSADMIN role
C. Assign the custom role to the PUBLIC role
D. Add__CUSTOM to all custom role names
Answer: B
Explanation:
When creating roles that will serve as the owners of securable objects in the system, Snowflake recommends creating a hierarchy of custom roles, with the top-most custom role assigned to the system role SYSADMIN. 
This role structure allows system administrators to manage all objects in the account, such as warehouses and database objects, while restricting management of users and roles to the USERADMIN role.

when sampling a table in snowflake, what can be specified
SEED

which statement describes a micro-partition in snowflake
All data in Snowflake tables is automatically divided into micro-partitions, which are contiguous units of storage. Each micro-partition contains between 50 MB and 500 MB of 
uncompressed data (note that the actual size in Snowflake is smaller because data is always stored compressed). Groups of rows in tables are mapped into individual micro-partitions, 
organized in a columnar fashion. This size and structure allows for extremely granular pruning of very large tables, which can be comprised of millions, or even hundreds of millions, of micro-partitions.

which file functions are non-deterministic
GET_PRESIGNED_URL and BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL are non-deterministic functions;

how can a bytes_spilled_to_remote query paramater value be improved

Virtual Private 

Pre-signed URL: Simple HTTPS URL used to access a file via a web browser. A file is temporarily accessible to users via this URL using a pre-signed access token. 
The expiration time for the access token is configurable. Ideal for business intelligence applications or reporting tools that need to display unstructured file contents.

Scoped URL: Encoded URL that permits temporary access to a staged file without granting privileges to the stage. 
The URL expires when the persisted query result period ends (i.e., the results cache expires), which is currently 24 hours. 
Ideal for use in custom applications, providing unstructured data to other accounts via a share, or for downloading and ad hoc analysis of unstructured data via Snowsight.

File URL: URL that identifies the database, schema, stage, and file path to a set of files. A role that has sufficient privileges on the stage can access the files. 
Ideal for custom applications that require access to unstructured data files. 

GET_PRESIGNED_URL 		=> helps generate the Pre-signed URL to access the unstructured data file
GET_RELATIVE_PATH 		=> helps extract the path of a staged file relative to its location in the stage using the stage name and absolute file path in cloud storage as inputs
GET_ABSOLUTE_PATH 		=> helps returns the absolute path of a staged file using the stage name and path of the file relative to its location in the stage as inputs.
GET_STAGE_LOCATION 		=> helps retrieve the URL for an external or internal named stage using the stage name as the input
BUILD_STAGE_FILE_URL 	=> helps generate the FILE URL to access the unstructured data file. Generates a Snowflake-hosted file URL to a staged file using the stage name and relative file path as inputs.
BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL 	=> helps generate the Scoped URL to access the unstructured data file?

Window			Window functions are aggregate functions that can operate on a subset of rows within the set of input rows.
Aggregate		Operate on values across rows to perform mathematical calculations such as sum, average, counting, minimum/maximum values,
System			Functions that perform control operations or return system-level information. 
Table			Functions that return results in tabular format. A table function returns a set of rows for each input row.
Scalar			A scalar function is a function that returns one value per invocation; in most cases, you can think of this as returning one value per row. 
User-defined	Define a SQL/JavaScript UDF to return either scalar or tabular output.

There are three types of accounts involved in data sharing.
Data Providers:  	Share data with others
Data Consumers: 	Accesses shared data with their own Snowflake account.
Reader Accounts: 	Query data using compute from the data provider's account. Reader Accounts are what you can use to share data with somebody who does not already have a Snowflake account.

Both non-materialized and materialized views can be defined as secure.

Snowflake can run a query for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 7 days. STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS is 172800 secs (2 days) default and 604800 secs (7 days) maximum

Snowflake keeps the batch load history for 64 days.

Snowflake’s architecture is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk and shared-nothing database architectures.

Temporary tables, stages, tasks, pipes, and external tables are not currently supported for replication.

Snowflake has two scaling Modes. Auto Scaling and Maximized.
	Auto-scale mode is enabled by specifying different values for maximum and minimum number of clusters.
	Maximized mode is enabled by specifying the same value for both maximum and minimum number of clusters. Value should be greater than 1

Snowflake has two scaling policies. Standard and Economy. This will be only used if the scaling mode is Auto Scale
	Standard -> Prevents/minimizes queuing by favoring starting additional clusters over conserving credits.
	Economy  -> Conserves credits by favoring keeping running clusters fully-loaded rather than starting additional clusters, which may result in queries being queued and taking longer to complete

Snowflake DOES not prune micro-partitions based on a predicate with a subquery, even if the subquery results in a constant.

ONLY ACCOUNTADMIN role (or a role granted the CREATE ACCOUNT global privilege) can create the Reader account.

SYSTEM | BLOCK sampling is often faster than BERNOULLI | ROW sampling.

OBJECT is also called a “dictionary”, “hash”, or “map” in many languages. This contains key-value pairs.

ONLY JSON and Parquet file formats are supported for data unloading.

VALIDATION_MODE instructs the COPY command to validate the data files instead of loading them into the specified table

Snowpipe is designed to load small volumes of data

Search optimization is a table-level property and applies to all columns with supported data types.

UDF ONLY runs as the function owner. A stored procedure runs with either the caller’s rights or the owner’s rights.
