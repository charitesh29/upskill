SNOWFLAKE::
-----------

* SNOWFLAKE IS A CLOUD BASED DATA WAREHOUSING SOLUTION, FOUNDED IN 2012.
* SNOWFLAKE OFFERS DATA STORAGE AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. 
* SNOWFLAKE DOES NOT HAVE THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE.
* IT RUNS ON AMAZON S3, MICROSOFT AZURE, AND THE GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM.
* SNOWFLAKE RUNS COMPLETELY ON CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE. 
* AVAILABLE AS SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE.

=========================================================================================================

WHY SNOWFLAKE?::
----------------

* PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE MODEL.
* IT IS A CLOUD PLATFORM, NO INFRASTRUCTURE COST.
* SNOWFLAKE IS MORE THAN A DATAWAREHOUSE.
* IT ALSO HELPS IN SOME TRANSFORMATIONS, CREATE DATA PIPES, CREATE VISUAL DASHBOARD ETC.
* HIGH SCALABILITY.
* DATA RECOVERY, BACKUP, SHARING, MASKING.
* CAN ANALYZE THE DATA PRESENT IN EXTERNAL FILES.
* EASY INTEGRATION WITH DATA VISUALIZATION/REPORTING TOLLS.

=========================================================================================================

SNOWFLAKE ARCHITECTURE::
------------------------

IT HAS THREE LAYERS

1] CLOUD LAYER

2] QUERY PROCESSING LAYER

3] DATABASE STORAGE LAYER

DATABASE STORAGE LAYER:
------------------------

* STORES TABLE DATA AND QUERY RESULTS
* DATA WILL BE STORED IN COLUMNAR FORMAT
* DATA WILL BE STORED IN MICRO PARTITIONS
* SNOWFLAKE MANAGES ALL ASPECTS OF HOW THIS DATA IS STORED I.E. THE DATA ORGANIZATION, FILE SIZE, STRUCTURE, COMPRESSION, METADATA, STATISTICS
* WE CAN DEFINE CLUSTER KEYS ON LARGE TABLES FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE.

QUERY PROCESSING LAYER:
------------------------

* THIS IS THE ACTUAL PROCESSING UNIT OF SNOWFLAKE 
* SNOWFLAKE PROCESSES QUERIES USING “VIRTUAL WAREHOUSES”
* EACH VIRTUAL WAREHOUSE IS COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE COMPUTE NODES ALLOCATED BY SNOWFLAKE FROM A CLOUD PROVIDER.
* ON AWS THEY ARE A GROUP OF EC2 INSTANCES AND ON AZURE A GROUP OF VIRTUAL MACHINES
* COMPUTE COST WILL BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF QUERY EXECUTION TIME ON VIRTUAL WAREHOUSES
* VIRTUAL WAREHOUSES ARE CONSIDERED AS THE MUSCLE OF THE SYSTEM
* CAN SCALE UP AND SCALE DOWN EASILY
* AUTO-SUSPEND AND AUTO-RESUME IS AVAILABLE

CLOUD SERVICES LAYER:
---------------------

* COLLECTION OF SERVICES THAT COORDINATE ACTIVITIES ACROSS SNOWFLAKE
* THIS IS THE BRAIN OF THE SNOWFLAKE
* AUTHENTICATION AND ACCESS CONTROL
* INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT
* METADATA MANAGEMENT
* SECURITY
* MANAGES ALL SERVERLESS TASKS LIKE SNOWPIPE, TASKS, MATERIALIZED VIEW MAINTENANCE ETC.

=========================================================================================================

VIRTUAL WARE HOUSE IN SNOWFLAKE::
---------------------------------

--> A ‘VIRTUAL WAREHOUSE’ IS A CLUSTER OF ONE OR MORE COMPUTE RESOURCES USED TO PROCESS QUERIES AND OTHER DML OPERATIONS

* WAREHOUSES COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES(XS,S,M,L,XL,2XL,3XL,4XL,5XL,6XL).THE SIZE OF WAREHOUSE DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF SERVERS IN EACH CLUSTER IN THE WAREHOUSE. 

* EACH INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN SIZE DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF SERVERS AT THE SAME TIME COST WILL BE INCREASED

* IF RESOURCES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO CONCURRENTLY PROCESS ALL QUERIES,THEN QUERIES GET QUEUED FOR EXECUTION AND THEN GETS EXECUTED AS RESOURCES BECOMES AVAILABLE


SNOWFLAKE PROVIDES TWO OPTIONS FOR INCREASING THE COMPUTER RESOURCES::

--> 1]  SCALE UP (OR) VERTICAL SCALING
        (INCREASING OR DECREASING THE SIZE OF VIRTUAL WAREHOUSE)
		
		* RESIZING - INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE VW IF YOUR QUERIES ARE TAKING TOO LONG OR DATA LOADING IS SLOW
		
		* YOU CAN INCREASE THE VW ANYTIME USING THE WEB UI OR SQL INTERFACE.
	  
--> 2]  SCALE OUT (OR) HORIZONTAL SCALING
		(INCREASING OR DECREASING THE NUMBER OF CLUSTERS)
		
		* AS LOAD INCREASES THE SAME WAREHOUSE WILL AUTOMATICALLY STARTS MORE CLUSTER TO PREVENT QUERIES FROM QUEUING. 
		 THEN WHEN ADDITIONAL CLUSTERS ARE NO LONGER NEEDED, IT SHUTS THOSE ADDITIONAL CLUSTER WHICH WERE LAUNCHED. 
		 MULTI-CLUSTERING IS AN ENTERPRISE EDITION FEATURE

=========================================================================================================	

MICRO PARTITIONS AND CLUSTERING IN SNOWFLAKE::
----------------------------------------------

---> MICRO PARTITIONS (***IMP***):: 
-----------------------------------

IN SNOWFLAKE, MICRO-PARTITIONS ARE A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF ITS ARCHITECTURE USED FOR ORGANIZING AND STORING DATA EFFICIENTLY.
 
THEY ARE THE SMALLEST UNIT OF STORAGE WITHIN A SNOWFLAKE TABLE AND PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ENABLING SNOWFLAKE'S PERFORMANCE, SCALABILITY, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS.

* SNOWFLAKE HAS IMPLEMENTED A POWERFUL AND UNIQUE FORM OF PARTITIONING, CALLED MICRO-PARTITIONING.

* MICRO-PARTITIONING IS AUTOMATICALLY PERFORMED ON ALL SNOWFLAKE TABLES. 

* TABLES ARE TRANSPARENTLY PARTITIONED USING THE ORDERING OF THE DATA AS IT IS INSERTED/LOADED.

* MICRO-PARTITIONS ARE SMALL IN SIZE (50 TO 500 MB).

* DATA IS COMPRESSED IN MICRO PARTITIONS

* SNOWFLAKE AUTOMATICALLY DETERMINES THE MOST EFFICIENT COMPRESSION ALGORITHM FOR THE COLUMNS IN EACH MICRO-PARTITION.


---> METADATA OF MICRO PARTITIONS::
-----------------------------------

* METADATA ALSO MAINTAINED BY SNOWFLAKE WHICH INCLUDES…

--> THE NUMBER OF DISTINCT VALUES FOR EACH FIELD 
--> THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR EACH FIELD 
--> OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE.

* METADATA IS A KEY PART OF THE SNOWFLAKE ARCHITECTURE AS IT ALLOWS QUERIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE DATA INSIDE A MICRO-PARTITION SHOULD BE QUERIED.
 
* THIS WAY, WHEN A QUERY IS EXECUTED, IT DOES NOT NEED TO SCAN THE ENTIRE DATASET BUT INSTEAD ONLY QUERIES THE MICRO-PARTITIONS THAT HOLD RELEVANT DATA.
 
* THIS PROCESS IS KNOWN AS QUERY PRUNING, AS THE DATA IS PRUNED BEFORE THE QUERY ITSELF IS EXECUTED.(***IMP***)


---> BENEFITS OF MICRO PARTITIONING::
------------------------------------

* IN CONTRAST TO TRADITIONAL STATIC PARTITIONING,SNOWFLAKE MICRO-PARTITIONS ARE DERIVED AUTOMATICALLY THEY DON’T NEED TO BE EXPLICITLY DEFINED UP-FRONT OR MAINTAINED BY USERS.

* MICRO-PARTITIONS ARE SMALL IN SIZE (50 TO 500 MB), WHICH ENABLES EXTREMELY EFFICIENT DML AND FINE-GRAINED PRUNING FOR FASTER QUERIES.

* COLUMNS ARE STORED INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN MICRO-PARTITIONS, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS COLUMNAR STORAGE. 
  THIS ENABLES EFFICIENT SCANNING OF INDIVIDUAL COLUMNS; ONLY THE COLUMNS REFERENCED BY A QUERY ARE SCANNED.

* COLUMNS ARE ALSO COMPRESSED INDIVIDUALLY WITHIN MICRO-PARTITIONS, THIS OPTIMIZES THE STORAGE COST.


---> HOW MICRO-PARTITIONS WORKS::
---------------------------------

WHEN THE DATA IS LOADED INTO SNOWFLAKE IT GOES THROUGH VIA EXTERNA STAGE OR INTERNAL LOADING ,THE CLOUD SERVICE LAYER ANALYSES THE DATA CHUNK AND CONVERTS INTO
COLUMNAR STYLE AND COMPRESS IT AND CREATES A MICO-PARTITIONS.

IT USER ANALYSES A QUERY THEN THE CLOUD SERVICE LAYER WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT MICRO PARTITIONS CREATES A PHYSICAL PLAN IN A OPTIMAL WAY AND SERVES RESULT

MICRO-PARTITIONS ARE IMMUTABLE(***IMP***). 


--->MICRO-PARTITION-(CLUSTERING DEPTH AND OVERLAP)::
----------------------------------------------------

IN SNOWFLAKE AFTER LOADING DATA THE MICRO-PARTITIONS ARE CREATED WHERE THE IT IS PARTIONED BY A COLUMN AND NO OF MICO-PARTITIONS ARE CREATED.

--> CLUSTERING DEPTH::
---------------------

CLUSTERING DEPTH REFERS TO THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS USED FOR SORTING DATA WITHIN EACH MICRO-PARTITION.
 
SNOWFLAKE ALLOWS USERS TO DEFINE CLUSTERING KEYS ON TABLES, SPECIFYING THE COLUMNS TO USE FOR SORTING THE DATA WITHIN EACH MICRO-PARTITION.

THE CLUSTERING DEPTH IS DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN THIS CLUSTERING KEY.

CHOOSING AN OPTIMAL CLUSTERING DEPTH IS ESSENTIAL FOR MAXIMIZING PERFORMANCE GAINS. 

--> CLUSTERING OVERLAP: 
-----------------------

OVERLAPPING CLUSTERING REFERS TO SITUATIONS WHERE A COLUMN USED FOR ONE LEVEL OF CLUSTERING ALSO APPEARS IN ANOTHER LEVEL OF CLUSTERING WITHIN THE SAME TABLE. 
THIS HAPPENS WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE COLUMNS DESIGNATED FOR CLUSTERING, AND THERE IS AN OVERLAP OF THOSE COLUMNS BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLUSTERING KEYS.

OVERLAP CAN IMPACT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CLUSTERING. IF COLUMNS OVERLAP IN DIFFERENT CLUSTERING KEYS, IT MIGHT NOT OPTIMIZE STORAGE AS EFFECTIVELY AS DISTINCT COLUMNS.

OVERLAP MIGHT OCCUR INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY BASED ON HOW CLUSTERING KEYS ARE SELECTED AND DEFINED.


--> AVG_DEPTH::
---------------

* BASED ON FREQUENCY AND NO OF PARTITIONS THE AVERAGE DEPTH IS CALCULATED

	AVG_DEPTH=(FREQUENCY / NO OF PARTITIONS)

=========================================================================================================	

---> CLUSTERING IN SNOWFLAKE (***IMP***)::
------------------------------------------

IN SNOWFLAKE, CLUSTERING REFERS TO THE PROCESS OF ORGANIZING DATA WITHIN TABLES TO IMPROVE QUERY PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE COSTS. 

SNOWFLAKE SUPPORTS CLUSTERING KEYS, WHICH ARE USED TO PHYSICALLY ORDER DATA WITHIN A TABLE BASED ON ONE OR MORE COLUMNS.
 
CLUSTERING CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE QUERY PERFORMANCE BY MINIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE SCANNED TO FULFILL A QUERY, THUS REDUCING QUERY EXECUTION TIME AND COST.



* CLUSTERING IS A KEY FACTOR IN QUERY PERFORMANCE, IT REDUCES THE SCANNING OF MICRO PARTITIONS.

* A CLUSTERING KEY IS A SUBSET OF COLUMNS IN A TABLE THAT ARE EXPLICITLY DESIGNATED TO CO-LOCATE THE DATA IN THE TABLE IN THE MICRO-PARTITIONS.

* INITIALLY THE DATA WILL BE STORED IN MICRO PARTITIONS IN THE ORDER OF INSERTING RECORDS, THEN WILL BE REALIGNED BASED ON THE CLUSTER KEYS.

* WE HAVE TO CHOOSE PROPER CLUSTER KEYS..

* WE CAN DEFINE CLUSTER KEYS ON MULTIPLE COLUMNS AS WELL.

* WE CAN MODIFY THE CLUSTER KEYS BASED ON OUR REQUIREMENTS, THIS IS CALLED AS RE-CLUSTERING.

* RE-CLUSTERING CONSUMES CREDITS, NUMBER OF CREDITS CONSUMED DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE TABLE.


---> DEFINING CLUSTER KEYS::
----------------------------

DEFINING CLUSTER KEYS WHILE TABLE CREATION:
------------------------------------------

CREATE TABLE MY_TABLE 
(
TYPE NUMBER, 
NAME STRING,
COUNTRY STRING,
DATE DATE,
)
CLUSTER BY (NAME);

--> MODIFYING CLUSTER KEYS ON EXISTING TABLE:

ALTER   TABLE MY_TABLE   CLUSTER BY (NAME, DATE);


---> CHOOSING CLUSTER KEYS::
----------------------------

DEFINE CLUSTER KEYS ON::
------------------------

* COLUMNS FREQUENTLY USED IN FILTER CONDITIONS (WHERE CLAUSE)

* COLUMNS USING AS JOIN KEYS

* FREQUENTLY USED FUNCTIONS OR EXPRESSIONS
	LIKE YEAR(DATE), SUBSTRING(MED_CD,1,6)
	
SNOWFLAKE RECOMMENDS::
----------------------

DEFINE CLUSTER KEYS ON LARGE TABLES AND DON’T ON SMALL TABLES.

DON’T DEFINE CLUSTER KEYS ON MORE THAN 4 COLUMNS.

CLUSTERING WILL NOT WORK ON EXTERNAL TABLES ONLY PARTITION WORKS (***IMP***)


=========================================================================================================

DATA LOADING IN SNOWFLAKE::
---------------------------

--> STAGES IN SNOWFLAKE::
------------------------

* STAGES OR STAGING ARE PLACE TO PUT THINGS IN TEMPORARY AREA BEFORE MOVIG THEM TO A STABLE LOCATION ,IN SNOWFLAKE CONTEXT THEY ARE TABLES WHERE DATA TO BE LOADED.

* STAGES IN TRADITONAL WAREHOUSE IT IS MIDDLE STOP BETWEEN OLTP AND OLAP DATABASES 

---> TYPES OF STAGES IN SNOWFLAKE::
---------------------------------

* SNOWFLAKE HAS 4 TYPES OF STAGES 

	1] TABLE STAGE             
	
	* SNOWFLAKE AUTOMACTICALLY CREATES THIS STAGE AND USERS HOW CAN ACCESS THIS TABLE HAS ALSO CAN ACCESS THIS TABLE STAGE , IT CAN BE ACCESSED AS BELOW 
	  [@%TABLE NAME]  --> list @%loan_payment;
	
	2] USER STAGE
    
    * EVERY USER HAS A STAGE IN THE ACCOUNT AND CAN BE ACCESSED ONLY BY THAT USER,, IT CAN BE ACCESSED AS [@~LOGIN]       --> list @~;(TIDLE)
	
	3] NAMED INTERNAL STAGE    
	
	* INTERNAL STAGES CAN BE CREATED BY USERS UNLIKE USER STAGE AND TABLE STAGE AND CAN BE ACCESSED BY MORE THAN ONE USERS	[@STAGE NAME]
	
	4] NAMED EXTERNAL STAGE    [@STAGE NAME]


--> TWO TYPES OF LOADS::
------------------------

	1] BULK LOADING USING COPY COMMAND
	
	2] CONTINOUS LOADING USING SNOWPIPE


---> BULK LOADING USING COPY COMMAND::
--------------------------------------

* THIS OPTION ENABLES LOADING BATCHES OF DATA FROM FILES ALREADY AVAILABLE IN CLOUD STORAGE(EXTERNAL STAGES)

* WE HAVE TO CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION OBJECTS TO EXTRACT DATA FROM THESE CLOUD STORAGES.
 (OR)
* COPYING DATA FILES FROM A LOCAL MACHINE TO AN INTERNAL  STAGE(I.E. SNOWFLAKE) BEFORE LOADING THE DATA INTO TABLE.

* BULK LOADING USES VIRTUAL WAREHOUSES

* USERS ARE REQUIRED TO SIZE THE WAREHOUSE APPROPRIATELY TO ACCOMMODATE EXPECTED LOADS USING THE COPY COMMAND.

=========================================================================================================

WE CAN LOAD THE FILE OR DATA WHICH RESIDES IN YOUR ON PREMISES OR UR SERVER TO CLOUD THEN WE CAN PUT/LOAD THE FILE TO CLOUD TO ANY TABLE STAGE/USER STAGE/NAMED INTERNAL STAGE.

PUT COMMAND CAN ONLY BE USED BY SNOWSQL AND CANNOT BE USED BY WEB UI 

PUT file://E:\UPSKILL\emp.csv @%emp;

* IF WE HAVE BIG FILE OF AROUND 5 GB OR GRATET THEN WE CAN USE PARALLEL THREAD ( WHICH IS USED TO CHUNKS THE DATA AND LOAD INTO CLOUD)

PUT file://E:\UPSKILL\emp.csv @%emp  parallel=2 overwrite=TRUE;

--> FILE FORMAT::
-----------------

WE CAN DEFINE A FILE FORMAT AND USE THIS IN LOADING THE FILE FROM STAGE INTO TABLES AT ONE TIME AND WE CAN USE AT ANY TIME

CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT MY_CSV_FORMAT

=========================================================================================================

---> DIFFRENT OPTIONS IN COPY COMMAND USING SNOWSQL/WEB UI FOR DATA LOADING::
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> * VALIDATION_MODE::
----------------------

VALIDATE THE DATA FILES INSTEAD OF LOADING THEM INTO THE TABLE

--> RETURN_ERRORS GIVES ALL ERRORS IN THE FILES

--> RETURN_ALL_ERRORS GIVES ALL ERRORS FROM PREVIOUSLY LOADED FILES IF WE HAVE USED ON_ERROR = CONTINUE

--> RETURN_N_ROWS DISPLAYS FIRST N RECORDS AND FAILS AT THE FIRST ERROR RECORD


---> * RETURN_FAILED_ONLY::
--------------------------

SPECIFIES WHETHER TO RETURN ONLY FILES THAT HAVE FAILED TO LOAD IN THE STATEMENT RESULT.

THIS USE CASE WORKS WHEN WE HAVE TO LOAD MUTIPLE FILES AND WE NEED TO RETURN ONLY FILE NAMES WHICH HAS ERROS

COPY INTO <table_name>
FROM  @ExternalStage
FILES = ( '<file_name>','<file_name2>') 
FILE_FORMAT = <file_format_name>
RETURN_FAILED_ONLY = TRUE | FALSE ;

--> DEFAULT IS FALSE

---> * ON_ERROR::
-----------------

COPY INTO <TABLE_NAME>
FROM  @EXTERNALSTAGE
FILES = ( '<FILE_NAME>','<FILE_NAME2>') 
FILE_FORMAT = <FILE_FORMAT_NAME>
ON_ERROR = CONTINUE | SKIP_FILE | SKIP_FILE_NUM | 
		SKIP_FILE_NUM% | ABORT_STATEMENT

-->  CONTINUE – TO SKIP ERROR RECORDS AND LOAD REMAINING RECORDS

-->  SKIP_FILE – TO SKIP THE FILES THAT CONTAIN ERRORS

-->  SKIP_FILE_NUM – SKIP A FILE WHEN THE NUMBER OF ERROR ROWS FOUND IN THE FILE IS EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDS THE SPECIFIED NUMBER.

-->  SKIP_FILE_NUM% – SKIP A FILE WHEN THE PERCENTAGE OF ERROR ROWS FOUND IN THE FILE EXCEEDS THE SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE.

-->  DEFAULT IS ABORT_STATEMENT, ABORT THE LOAD OPERATION IF ANY ERROR IS FOUND IN A DATA FILE

---> * FORCE::
--------------

COPY INTO <TABLE_NAME>
FROM  @EXTERNALSTAGE
FILES = ( '<FILE_NAME>','<FILE_NAME2>') 
FILE_FORMAT = <FILE_FORMAT_NAME>
FORCE = TRUE | FALSE ;

--> TO LOAD ALL THE FILES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY’VE BEEN LOADED PREVIOUSLY

--> DEFAULT IS FALSE, IF WE DON’T SPECIFY THIS PROPERTY COPY COMMAND WILL NOT FAIL BUT IT SKIPS LOADING THE DATA

---> * SIZE_LIMIT::
-------------------

COPY INTO <TABLE_NAME>
FROM  @EXTERNALSTAGE
FILES = ( '<FILE_NAME>','<FILE_NAME2>') 
FILE_FORMAT = <FILE_FORMAT_NAME>
SIZE_LIMIT = <NUMBER> ;

--> SPECIFY MAXIMUM SIZE IN BYTES OF DATA LOADED IN THAT COMMAND

--> WHEN THE THRESHOLD IS EXCEEDED, THE COPY OPERATION STOPS LOADING

--> IN CASE OF MULTIPLE FILES OF SAME PATTERN ALSO IT WILL STOP AFTER THE SIZE LIMIT,THAT MEANS SOME FILES CAN BE LOADED FULLY AND ONE FILE WILL BE LOADED PARTIALLY

---> * TRUNCATECOLUMNS OR ENFORCE_LENGTH::
-----------------------------------------

COPY INTO <TABLE_NAME>
FROM  @EXTERNALSTAGE
FILES = ( '<FILE_NAME>','<FILE_NAME2>') 
FILE_FORMAT = <FILE_FORMAT_NAME>
TRUNCATECOLUMNS = TRUE | FALSE – DEFAULT IS FALSE ;
(OR) ENFORCE_LENGTH = TRUE | FALSE – DEFAULT IS TRUE ;

--> SPECIFIES WHETHER TO TRUNCATE TEXT STRINGS THAT EXCEEDS THE TARGET COLUMN LENGTH

--> DEFAULT IS FALSE, THAT MEANS IF WE DON’T SPECIFY THIS OPTION, AND IF TEXT STRINGS THAT EXCEEDS THE TARGET COLUMN LENGTH, THEN COPY COMMAND WILL FAIL

---> * PURGE::
--------------

COPY INTO <TABLE_NAME>
FROM  @EXTERNALSTAGE
FILES = ( '<FILE_NAME>','<FILE_NAME2>') 
FILE_FORMAT = <FILE_FORMAT_NAME>
PURGE = TRUE | FALSE

--> SPECIFIES WHETHER TO REMOVE THE DATA FILES FROM THE STAGE AUTOMATICALLY AFTER THE DATA IS LOADED SUCCESSFULLY.

--> DEFAULT IS FALSE

---> * LOAD_UNCERTAIN_FILES::
-----------------------------

COPY INTO <TABLE_NAME>
FROM  @EXTERNALSTAGE
FILES = ( '<FILE_NAME>','<FILE_NAME2>') 
FILE_FORMAT = <FILE_FORMAT_NAME>
LOAD_UNCERTAIN_FILES = TRUE | FALSE

--> SPECIFIES TO LOAD FILES FOR WHICH THE LOAD STATUS IS UNKNOWN. THE COPY COMMAND SKIPS THESE FILES BY DEFAULT.

NOTE: 
-----

THE LOAD STATUS IS UNKNOWN IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE TRUE::

--> THE FILE’S LAST_MODIFIED DATE IS OLDER THAN 64 DAYS.

--> THE INITIAL SET OF DATA WAS LOADED INTO THE TABLE MORE THAN 64 DAYS EARLIER.

--> IF THE FILE WAS ALREADY LOADED SUCCESSFULLY INTO THE TABLE, THIS EVENT OCCURRED MORE THAN 64 DAYS EARLIER.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> VALIDATION MODE IN PRACTICAL::
-----------------------------------

BEFORE LOADING YOUR DATA, WE CAN VALIDATE THAT THE DATA IN THE UPLOADED FILES WILL LOAD CORRECTLY.

TO VALIDATE DATA IN AN UPLOADED FILE, EXECUTE COPY INTO <TABLE> IN VALIDATION MODE USING THE VALIDATION_MODE PARAMETER. 

THE VALIDATION_MODE PARAMETER RETURNS ANY ERRORS THAT IT ENCOUNTERS IN A FILE. WE CAN THEN MODIFY THE DATA IN THE FILE TO ENSURE IT LOADS WITHOUT ERROR.

EG::
----

COPY INTO EMP_VALIDATION FROM @FLIGHT_RAW_STAGE/emp.csv
file_format='FLIGHT_PERFORMANCE_RAW_FORMAT'
VALIDATION_MODE=RETURN_ALL_ERRORS;

TYPES::
-------

* RETURN_ERRORS: IN THIS MODE, SNOWFLAKE LOADS THE DATA BUT GENERATES AN ERROR TABLE CONTAINING THE ROWS THAT FAILED VALIDATION. THIS MODE DOESN'T STOP THE LOADING PROCESS DUE TO VALIDATION ERRORS.

* RETURN_ALL_ERRORS: SIMILAR TO RETURN_ERRORS, THIS MODE LOADS THE DATA BUT GENERATES AN ERROR TABLE CONTAINING ALL ROWS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT PASS VALIDATION. IT DOESN'T STOP THE LOADING PROCESS DUE TO VALIDATION ERRORS BUT REPORTS ALL ERRORS.

* RETURN_N_ROWS: IN THIS MODE IT WILL RETUN FIRST ROW IF ANY ERRORS OR RETUN FIRST N VALUES SPECIFIED IF THE DATA LOOKS GOOD FOR LOADING


--> IN ORDER TO READ OR TRANSFORM THE DATA IN STAGING AREA VIA SNOWSQL ,BELOW COMMAND ARE USED WITH FILE_FORMAT 

****VERY IMP******

select $1,$2,$3,$4,to_date($5) as date from @%emp (file_format=>'MY_CSV_FORMAT') WHERE $1=7839;

=========================================================================================================

--> LOADING SAME FILE INTO TABLE FROM STAGE::
--------------------------------------------- 

* SNOWFLAKE WILL HAVE THE METADATA STORED FOR EACH FILE WHICH WAS PUSHED INTO STAGE.

	 * MD5 (MESSAGE-DIGEST ALGORITHM)
	 
	 * LAST MODIFIED TIMESTAMP

* SO WHENVER WE TRY TO LOAD SAME FILE IT WILL RETURN 0 ROWS PROCESSED, IF THE SIGNATURE OF FILE CHNAGED AND WE RE-STAGE THE FILE THEN SNOWFLAKE WILL PROCESS

* ALSO WE CAN USE FORCE=TRUE IN ORDER TO LOAD SAME FILE WITHOUT CHANGING SIGNATURE , BUT THE DUPLICATE DATA WILL BE LOADED

=========================================================================================================

--> LOADING SAME FILE INTO TABLE FROM STAGE IF IT IS PARTIALLY LOADED::
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

***PRODUCTION SCENARIO***

LET'S SUPPOSE AN FILE (EMP.CSV) IS LOADED INTO MAIN TABLE WHERE AS IT HAS SOME ERRORS AND PARTIALLY LOADED.

THEN HOST TEAM WILL CORRECT THE DATA AND RE-SEND THE FILE THE ENTIRE DATA WILL BE SENDED BACK ALONG WITH UPDATED ONE.

IF WE LOAD SAME FILE THEN THERE WILL BE AN DUPLICATION OF DATA, WHICH WE DONT REQUIRE TO LOAD.

--> SOLUTION::
--------------

HERE THE APPROACH SHOULD BE AN STAGING TABLE SHOULD BE CREATED AND WE NEED TO USE MERGE (COMMAND) TO LOAD THE NEW DATA INTO MAIN TABLE.

put file://E:\UPSKILL\SNOWFLAKE\FILES\DATA\emp1.csv @flight_raw_stage

COPY INTO EMP_STG FROM @flight_raw_stage/emp1.csv 
file_format='FLIGHT_PERFORMANCE_RAW_FORMAT';

EG::
----

MERGE INTO EMP E USING EMP_STG ES ON(E.EMPNO=ES.EMPNO)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET E.ENAME=ES.ENAME,E.JOB=ES.JOB,E.MGR=ES.MGR,E.HIREDATE=ES.HIREDATE,E.SAL=ES.SAL,E.COMM=ES.COMM,E.DEPTNO=ES.DEPTNO
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
INSERT VALUES (ES.EMPNO,ES.ENAME,ES.JOB,ES.MGR,ES.HIREDATE,ES.SAL,ES.COMM,ES.DEPTNO);

=========================================================================================================

***COPY INTO TO LOG THE ERROR(PROD USE CASE) SCENARIO***::
-------------------------------------------

--->RESULT_SCAN::
-----------------

RETURNS THE RESULT SET OF A PREVIOUS COMMAND (WITHIN 24 HOURS OF WHEN YOU EXECUTED THE QUERY) AS IF THE RESULT WAS A TABLE.

QUERY YOU EXECUTED ON METADATA OR ACCOUNT USAGE INFORMATION, SUCH AS SNOWFLAKE INFORMATION SCHEMA OR ACCOUNT USAGE.

THE RESULT OF A STORED PROCEDURE THAT YOU CALLED.

THE COMMAND/QUERY CAN BE FROM THE CURRENT SESSION OR ANY OF YOUR OTHER SESSIONS, INCLUDING PAST SESSIONS, AS LONG AS THE 24 HOUR PERIOD HAS NOT ELAPSED. 
THIS PERIOD IS NOT ADJUSTABLE.

EG::
----
IF WE PASS 1 THEN IT WILL FETCH RESULT SET OF FIRST SUCESSFULL EXECUTED RESUT, -1 WILL GIVE YOU THE LAST RECORD

SELECT * FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(1));

***USECASE****

WE CAN LOG THE ERROR BY USING THE RESULT_SCAN FUNCTION IN SNOWFLAKE
 
SET QID=LAST_QUERY_ID(); ---DECLARING THE VARIABLE

COPY INTO @FLIGHT_RAW_STAGE/ERRORS/LOAD_ERRORS FROM (SELECT * FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN($QID))) OVERWRITE=TRUE; ---COPYING THE CONTENT INTO FILE/TABLE FROM RESULT_SCAN.


BELOW COMMAND IS USED TO DOWNLOAD/MOVE THE FILE TO SPECIFIC FOLDER::(***IMP***)

****LOADING SEMI STRCTURED DATA****::
------------------------------------

--> JSON (JAVASCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION) FILE FORMAT::
---------------------------------------------------

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format used to transmit and store data. 
It's often used in web development, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), data serialization due to its simplicity and readability. 

JSON is based on two fundamental structures:

Objects: Enclosed in curly braces {}, objects consist of key-value pairs. Each key is a string, followed by a colon :, and then the corresponding value.
Keys are unique within an object, and the value can be any valid JSON data type (string, number, boolean, object, array, null).

Example:
--------

{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown"
    },
    "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "coding"]
}

Arrays: Enclosed in square brackets [], arrays hold an ordered list of values. 

Values within arrays can be of any valid JSON data type, including objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, or null.

Example:
--------

[
    "apple",
    "banana",
    "orange"
]


Data Types in JSON:
-------------------

* Strings: Sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

Example: "Hello, World"
--------

* Numbers: Integers or floating-point numbers.

Example: 42, 3.14
--------

* Booleans: true or false.

* Null: Represents an empty value.

Example: null
--------

Example:
--------

Let's break down a sample JSON file:


{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "isStudent": true,
    "address": {
        "street": "456 Elm St",
        "city": "Somewhere"
    },
    "hobbies": ["painting", "gardening"],
    "previous_jobs": [
        {
            "title": "Assistant",
            "company": "ABC Inc"
        },
        {
            "title": "Intern",
            "company": "XYZ Corp"
        }
    ]
}

"name", "age", "isStudent" are keys, each followed by their respective values.

"address" is an object containing nested key-value pairs.

"hobbies" is an array containing multiple string values.

"previous_jobs" is an array containing objects with keys "title" and "company".

---> WORKING WITH JSON DATA IN SNOWFLAKE::
-----------------------------------------

JSON FILE FORMAT::
------------------

* (VARIANT) IS THE DATAYPE WHICH IS DEFINED FOR WORKING WITH ALL KIND OF SEMI-STRCTURED DATA IN SNOWFLAKE

CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT MY_JSON_FORMAT TYPE='JSON'; 

* STAGING THE JSON DATA IN A INTERNAL STAGE

PUT FILE://E:\UPSKILL\SNOWFLAKE\FILES\DATA\EMP.JSON @MY_STAGE;

* $1 IS THE ONLY COLUMN WHICH THE JSON VALUE CAN BE RETRIVED VIA STAGE IN JSON DATA ( THE KEY IS THE CASE SENSTIVE IN SNOWFLAKE) 

EXAMPLE::
---------

SELECT
    $1:deptName::STRING AS deptName,
    $1:deptno::INT AS deptno,
    $1:deptLocation::STRING AS loc,
    $1:deptLocState::STRING AS state,
    $1:EmployeeDtls AS EmployeeDtls
from
    @my_stage/emp.json.gz (file_format => 'my_json_format');
	
(****VERY IMP***)	

---> LATERAL FLATTEN:: (THIS IS ADYNAMIC TABLE WHICH WE FLATTEN THE ARRAY DATA INTO COLUMN FORMAT AND IT HAS A COLUMN CALLED VALUE)
----------------------

* IN ORDER TO EXTRACT THE ARRAY DETAILS IN NESTED JSON , SNOWFLAKE PROVIDED AN FUCNTION CALLED LATERAL FLATTEN.

* VALUE IS THE ONLY COLUMN WHICH WE CAN ACCESS THE FLATTEND DATA 

	emp.value:empno::INT as empno,
	emp.value:ename::STRING as ename,
	emp.value:job::STRING as job,
	emp.value:hiredate::DATE as hiredate

EXAMPLE THE BELOW COMMAND IS USED TO RETRIVE DATA IN STAGE USING SNOWSQL::
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT
    dept.$1:deptName::STRING AS deptName,
    dept.$1:deptno::INT AS deptno,
    dept.$1:deptLocation::STRING AS loc,
    dept.$1:deptLocState::STRING AS state,
	emp.value:empno::INT as empno,
	emp.value:ename::STRING as ename,
	emp.value:job::STRING as job,
	emp.value:hiredate::DATE as hiredate
from
    @my_stage/emp.json.gz (file_format => 'my_json_format') dept,
	lateral flatten(input=>$1:EmployeeDtls) emp;

EXAMPLE THE BELOW COMMAND IS USED TO RETRIVE DATA FROM TABLE  USING SNOWSQL/SNOWFLAKE::
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
select 
dept.emp_dept:deptName::string as deptName,
dept.emp_dept:deptno::int as deptno,
dept.emp_dept:deptLocation::string as deptLocation,
dept.emp_dept:deptLocState::string as deptLocState,
emp.value:empno::int as empno,
emp.value:ename::string as ename,
emp.value:hiredate::date as hiredate,
emp.value:job::string as job
from emp_json dept,
lateral flatten (input=>emp_dept:EmployeeDtls) emp;

(****IMP****) PLAIN JSON::
--------------------------

* FOR PLAIN JSON FILE THERE IS NO NEE OF LATERAL FALTTEN AS WE CAN ACCESS THE COLUMNS USING COLUMN NAME.JSON ELEMENTS

EG::
----

select
    cust_dtl:c_acctbal::NUMBER AS c_acctbal,
    cust_dtl:c_address::STRING AS c_address,
    cust_dtl:c_comment::STRING AS c_comment,
    cust_dtl:c_custkey::INT AS c_custkey,
    cust_dtl:c_mktsegment::STRING AS c_mktsegment,
    cust_dtl:c_name::STRING AS c_name,
    cust_dtl:c_nationkey::INT AS c_nationkey
from
    cust_json;
	

---> NESTED JSON::(IOT.JSON FILE)
------------------

* LETS SUPPOSE WE HAVE A JSON WITH 3 ELEMETS AND ONE OF ELEMENT HAS ARRAY VALUE AND IT HAS A ELEMETS INSIDE OF IT

* WE CAN USE THE LATERAL FLATTEN FOR THE ARRAY ELEMENT AND THE NESTED ELEMENTS CAN BE ACCESSED WITH TABLE.VALUE::ELEMENT NAME 

EG:: (IOT.JSON DATA)
-------------------- 	

select 
sdata:device_type::string as device_type,
evnt.value:f::NUMBER f,
evnt.value:rv::STRING rv,
evnt.value:t::STRING t,
evnt.value:v.ACHZ ACHZ,
sdata:version::float as version
from iot_json io,
lateral flatten (input=>sdata:events) evnt;


--->STRIP OUTER ROW::
---------------------

* IF THE JSON FILE IS GENERATED STARTING WITH ARRAY, WE NEED TO MODIFY THE FILE FORMAT AND KEEP THE STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY=true and load the JSON FILE.

* IF THE STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY=FALSE THEN THE SNOWFLAKE WILL LOAD ENTIRE DATA INTO SINGLE ROW AND IF THE FILE SIZE IS MORE THAN 16 MB IT WILL FAIL

EG::
----

[
 {
 }
]  

=========================================================================================================

--->PARSE JSON::
----------------

* PARSE_JSON IS USED TO INSERT THE DATA INTO TABLE AS JSON FORMAT 

INSERT INTO PETS SELECT PARSE_JSON ('{"SPECIES":"DOG", "NAME":"FIDO", "IS_DOG":"TRUE"} ');
INSERT INTO PETS SELECT PARSE_JSON ('{"SPECIES":"CAT", "NAME":"BUBBY", "IS_DOG":"FALSE"}'); 
INSERT INTO PETS SELECT PARSE_JSON ('{"SPECIES":"CAT", "NAME":"DOG TERROR", "IS_DOG":"FALSE"}');
INSERT INTO PETS SELECT PARSE_JSON ('{"SPECIES":"BIRD", "NAME":"ROCKY", "IS_DOG":"FALSE"}');

SELECT 
V:SPECIES::STRING SPECIES,
V:NAME::STRING NAME,
V:IS_DOG::STRING IS_DOG
FROM PETS;

=========================================================================================================

select f.path ,TYPEOF(f.value) from EMP_DATA , lateral flatten (edata, RECURSIVE=>true) f; 


=========================================================================================================

-->SNOWFLAKE EXTERNAL STAGE::
-----------------------------

-->AWS S3::
-----------

* BASICALLY WHEN WE LOAD ANY DATA IN INTERNAL STAGE INTERNALLY IT GOES AND STORES IN STORAGE ARCHTECTURE WHERE IT INTERCATS WITH S3 IF IT IS HOSTED IN AWS, BLOB IN AZURE, GCP

 IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE S3 BUCKET VIA SNOWFLAKE , BELOW STEPS HAS TO BE FOLLOWED::
 
 1] CREATE IAM (IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT) ROLE  --> BASICALLY IT IS A KIND OF DB ROLE CREATION
 
 2] GRANT PRIVILAGE ON S3 BUCKET TO ROLE              --> BASICALLY IT IS A KIND OF DB SELECT GRANT TO ROLE
 
 3] GRANT ROLE TO SNOWFLAKE                           --> BASICALLY IT IS A KIND OF GRANTING A ROLE TO USER (HERE IT IS A SNOWFAKE)

====================================================================================================================

(****SNOWFLAKE OBJECTS****)

---> TYPE OF TABLES IN SNOWFLAKE::
----------------------------------

1] TEMPORARY TABLES

2] TRANSIENT TABLES (TT TABLES)

3] PERMANENT TABLES

4] EXTERNAL TABLES


TEMPORARY TABLES::
-------------------

* EXISTS THROUGH OUT THE SESSION

* THE DATA STORED IN THE TABLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL STORAGE CHARGES

* CAN CREATE TEMPORARY AND NON-TEMPORARY TABLES WITH THE SAME NAME WITHIN THE SAME SCHEMA.

* TEMPORARY TABLE TAKES PRECEDENCE IN THE SESSION (IF WE QUERY TABLE WHICH HAS SAME NAME THEN TEMPRARY IS REFERRED)

* CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE MYTEMPTABLE (ID NUMBER, CREATION_DATE DATE);
 
* DROP TABLE FOR DROPPING THE TEMPORARY TABLE

EG::
----

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE EMP AS SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=30;


TRANSIENT TABLES::
------------------

* TRANSIENT TABLES PERSIST UNTIL DROPPED EXPLICITLY

* TT - SIMILAR TO PERMANENT TABLES BUT DO NOT HAVE FAIL SAFE PERIOD

* TRANSIENT DATABASES AND SCHEMAS CAN BE CREATED AS WELL

* VISIBLE TO ANY USER WITH THE APPROPRIATE PRIVILEGES

* SYSTEM FAILURE – TT MAY BE LOST

* AFTER CREATION, TRANSIENT TABLES CANNOT BE CONVERTED TO ANY OTHER TABLE TYPE.

* TRANSIENT TABLES DO NOT HAVE A FAIL-SAFE PERIOD, THEY PROVIDE A GOOD OPTION FOR MANAGING THE COST OF VERY LARGE TABLES USED TO STORE TRANSITORY DATA

EG::
----

CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE MYTRANSTABLE (ID NUMBER, CREATION_DATE DATE);



---> EXTERNAL TABLES::
----------------------

EXTERNAL TABLES ARE SAME AS PHYSICAL TABLES BUT IT DOENST NOT HOLD ANY DATA IN SNOFLAKE ,IT WILL REFER THE DATA STORED IN UNDRLYING CLOUD STORAGES/STAGES.

SNOWFLAKE WILL HAVE ONLY THE METADATA INFO OF THE EXTERNAL STAGE, WHERE WILL REFER THE DATA AND RETRIVES IT FROM THE EXTERNAL LOCATION 

* EXTERNAL TABLES REFERENCE DATA FILES LOCATED IN A CLOUD STORAGE

* EXTERNAL TABLES STORE FILE-LEVEL METADATA ABOUT THE DATA FILES SUCH AS THE FILE PATH, A VERSION IDENTIFIER, AND PARTITIONING INFORMATION

* QUERY DATA FILES AS IF THEY WERE IN SNOWFLAKE

* KNOWLEDGE OF THE FILE FORMAT AND RECORD FORMAT OF THE SOURCE DATA FILES

* ALL EXTERNAL TABLES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING COLUMNS

	* VALUE: A VARIANT TYPE COLUMN THAT REPRESENTS A SINGLE ROW IN THE EXTERNAL FILE.
	
	* METADATA$FILENAME: A PSEUDOCOLUMN THAT IDENTIFIES THE NAME OF EACH STAGED DATA FILE INCLUDED IN THE EXTERNAL TABLE, INCLUDING ITS PATH IN THE STAGE.
	
* AFTER EXTERNAL TABLE CREATION MANUALLY EXECUTE ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE .. REFRESH COMMAND (AUTO_REFRESH=TRUE)

* EXTERNAL TABLE SUPPORTS AWS S3, AZURE AND GCP EXTERNAL STAGES ONLY

* THE VALUE COLUMN STRUCTURES ROWS IN A CSV DATA FILE AS JSON OBJECTS WITH ELEMENTS IDENTIFIED BY COLUMN POSITION, 
	E.G. {C1: COL_1_VALUE, C2: COL_2_VALUE, C3: COL_3_VALUE ...} 
	
* EXTERNAL TABLES – NO CLUSTERING, NO CLONING, NO DATA SHARING, NO XML DATA, NO TIME TRAVEL


 
EXTERNAL TABLE CREATION ::
--------------------------

---CREATING STAGE

CREATE STAGE MY_S3_STAGE
  STORAGE_INTEGRATION = S3_SNOWFLAKE_INT
  URL = 'S3://SFDBBUCKET1/'
  FILE_FORMAT = MY_CSV_FORMAT;

---CREATING AN EXTERNAL STAGE  
  
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE  MY_EXT_CUSTOMER  WITH LOCATION = @MY_S3_STAGE  AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE;

* ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE MY_EXT_CUSTOMER REFRESH;

* DROP EXTERNAL TABLE MY_EXT_CUSTOMER;

--> THE DATA IS LOADED INTO A VARIANT COLUMN

--> FOR QUERYING THE DATA USE VALUE FUNCTION -- SELECT VALUE:C1::STRING AS C_CUST_KEY , C_NAME FROM MY_EXT_CUSTOMER A


 
CONFIGURING EXTERNAL TABLE AUTO-REFRESH USING AMAZON SQS (AMAZON SIMPLE QUEUE SERVICE)::
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* DESC EXTERNAL TABLES  - SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES;
* COPY NOTIFICATION CHANNEL VALUE FROM THE DESCRIBED TABLES RESULT SET.
* LOG INTO AWS CONSOLE
* CONFIGURE EVENT NOTIFICATIONS
* NAME: NAME OF THE EVENT NOTIFICATION (E.G. AUTO-INGEST SNOWFLAKE).
* EVENTS: SELECT THE OBJECTCREATE (ALL) AND OBJECTREMOVED OPTIONS.
* SEND TO: SELECT SQS QUEUE FROM THE DROPDOWN LIST.
* SQS: SELECT ADD SQS QUEUE ARN FROM THE DROPDOWN LIST.
* SQS QUEUE ARN: PASTE THE SQS QUEUE NAME FROM THE SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES OUTPUT.
* STEP 5: MANUALLY REFRESH THE EXTERNAL TABLE METADATA (AGAIN)
* STEP 6: CONFIGURE SECURITY

GRANT SELECT ON EXTERNAL TABLE 
LIMITATIONS OF EXTERNAL TABLE AUTO-REFRESH USING AMAZON SQS
AWS LIMITS THE NUMBER OF THESE NOTIFICATION QUEUE CONFIGURATIONS TO A MAXIMUM OF 100 PER S3 BUCKET
 
====================================================================================================================

---> SNOWFLAKE VIEWS::
----------------------

TYPE OF VIEWS IN SNOWFLAKE:: 
----------------------------

* NORMAL/REGULAR VIEW 

* SECURED VIEWS

* MATERIALIZED VIEWS

	* ITS MORE OF TABLE
	
	* STORES DATA – STORAGE CHARGES APPLIED
	
	* CREATED IF COMPLEX PROCESSING LOGIC IS USED (EG::AGGREGATIONS)
	
	* CREATED IF QUERY RESULT WONT CHANGE MUCH OR SUBSET OF RESULTS WONT CHANGE MUCH
	
	* FASTER THAN TABLES BECAUSE OF CACHING
	
	* CACHE USED FOR UNCHANGED DATA SET
	
	* FETCH RESULTS FROM TABLE FOR THE CHANGED DATA SET


ADVANTAGES OF VIEWS::
---------------------

* ENCAPSULATION

* MODULARIZED CODE

* EXPOSE SUBSET OF DATA


MORE ABOUT MATERIALIZED VIEWS::
-----------------------------

* A MATERIALIZED VIEW IS A PRE-COMPUTED DATA SET DERIVED FROM A QUERY SPECIFICATION (THE SELECT IN THE VIEW DEFINITION) AND STORED FOR LATER USE

* WHEN IS A MATERIALIZED VIEW IS USED

	QUERY RESULTS CONTAIN A SMALL NUMBER OF ROWS AND/OR COLUMNS RELATIVE TO THE BASE TABLE (THE TABLE ON WHICH THE VIEW IS DEFINED).
	QUERY RESULTS CONTAIN RESULTS THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT PROCESSING, INCLUDING:
	ANALYSIS OF SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA.
	AGGREGATES THAT TAKE A LONG TIME TO CALCULATE
	
ADVANTAGES::
-------------

	* MATERIALIZED VIEWS ARE AUTOMATICALLY AND TRANSPARENTLY MAINTAINED BY SNOWFLAKE
	
LIMITATIONS::
-------------

* MV CAN BE CREATED ON ONE TABLE ONLY.

* JOINS, INCLUDING SELF-JOINS, ARE NOT SUPPORTED.

* THE MATERIALIZED VIEW IS TYPICALLY SLOWER THAN CACHED RESULTS. 
  THIS IS BECAUSE THE MATERIALIZED VIEW ALWAYS PROVIDES CURRENT DATA, SO IF THE MATERIALIZED VIEW IS NOT UP TO DATE, 
  IT READS THE UP TO DATE PORTION FROM THE MATERIALIZED VIEW AND REST OF THE DATA FROM THE BASE TABLES.
  
* THE MATERIALIZED VIEW HAS STORAGE AND COMPUTE RESOURCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. 
  THE COMPUTE COST IS DUE TO THE AUTOMATIC INTERNAL MAINTENANCE OF THE MATERIALIZED VIEW BY SNOWFLAKE.
 
--> A MATERIALIZED VIEW CANNOT QUERY::
 
     * A NON-MATERIALIZED VIEW.
     
     * A UDTF (USER-DEFINED TABLE FUNCTION).
	 
--> A MATERIALIZED VIEW CANNOT INCLUDE::

     * UDFS.
     * WINDOW FUNCTIONS.
     * HAVING CLAUSES.
     * ORDER BY CLAUSE.
     * LIMIT CLAUSE.
     * GROUP BY KEYS THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE SELECT LIST. ALL GROUP BY KEYS IN A MATERIALIZED VIEW MUST BE PART OF THE SELECT LIST.
     * NESTING OF SUBQUERIES WITHIN A MATERIALIZED VIEW
     * THESE DML OPS ARE NOT ALLOWED – COPY,DELETE,INSERT,MERGE,UPDATE
     * SNOWFLAKE’S “TIME TRAVEL” FEATURE IS NOT SUPPORTED ON MATERIALIZED VIEWS
  
====================================================================================================================

---> RESULTS CACHE::
--------------------

* CACHING THE QUERY RESULTS FOR THE RESULT FOR RE-USE

* RETENTION PERIOD--24 HRS

* MAX 31 DAYS FROM THE FIRST QUERY IS EXECUTED 
	
	* EACH TIME THE PERSISTED RESULT FOR A QUERY IS REUSED, SNOWFLAKE RESETS THE 24-HOUR RETENTION PERIOD FOR THE RESULT, 
	  UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 31 DAYS FROM THE DATE AND TIME THAT THE QUERY WAS FIRST EXECUTED. 
	  AFTER 31 DAYS, THE RESULT IS PURGED AND THE NEXT TIME THE QUERY IS SUBMITTED, A NEW RESULT IS GENERATED AND PERSISTED

* THE RESULT CACHE HELPS IN BUILDING A COST-EFFICIENT CACHE LAYER IN TERMS OF COMPUTE AND STORAGE.

* SESSION PARAMETER USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE; -->TO DISABLE THE CACHING NEED TO SET AS FALSE
	
	ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;
	
	
	
--> QUERY RESULTS ARE RE-USED BASED ON THE BELOW CRITERIA::
-----------------------------------------------------------

	* THE USER EXECUTING THE QUERY HAS THE NECESSARY ACCESS PRIVILEGES FOR ALL THE TABLES USED IN THE QUERY.
	
	* THE NEW QUERY SYNTACTICALLY MATCHES THE PREVIOUSLY-EXECUTED QUERY.
	
	* THE TABLE DATA CONTRIBUTING TO THE QUERY RESULT HAS NOT CHANGED.
	
	* THE PERSISTED RESULT FOR THE PREVIOUS QUERY IS STILL AVAILABLE.
	
	* THE QUERY DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNCTIONS THAT MUST BE EVALUATED AT EXECUTION (E.G. CURRENT_TIMESTAMP).
	
	* THE TABLE’S MICRO-PARTITIONS HAVE NOT CHANGED (E.G. BEEN RE CLUSTERED OR CONSOLIDATED) DUE TO CHANGES TO OTHER DATA IN THE TABLE.


--> ADVANTAGES::
----------------

* RESULTS ARE STORED IRRESPECTIVE OF DATA CHANGES IN THE BASE TABLE. THE QUERY EVALUATION DOES NOT WORK THERE. 

* IF THE BASE TABLE HAS NEW ROWS WHICH DO NOT IMPACT THE EARLIER QUERY RESULT, THE QUERY WON’T USE THE CACHED RESULTS. INSTEAD, IT WILL BE RE-EXECUTED.

* IT CAN HELP IN THE CASE OF A COMPLEX QUERY (I.E. QUERIES WITH MULTIPLE JOINS) NOT PERFORMING AS EXPECTED. 
  THESE QUERIES CAN BE FURTHER BROKEN DOWN INTO MULTIPLE SMALLER COMPONENTS USING THE RESULT CACHE’S FEATURES. 
  EG: IN A PROC EXECUTE A COMPLEX QUERY AND RE USE THE DATA FOR ANOTHER PROCESSING LOGIC

LIMITATIONS::
------------

* THERE IS A TRADE-OFF IN TERMS OF QUERY PERFORMANCE AND QUERY RESULT ROWS AND SIZE. IDEALLY, QUERY RESULT OUTPUT SHOULD BE SMALL WITH REGARD TO ROWS AND SIZE.

* SNOWFLAKE DOES NOT KEEP ANY METADATA FOR THE RESULT CACHE, AND HENCE THE RESULT OUTPUT IN TERMS OF ROWS AND SIZE DOES MATTER.

* THE QUERY RESULTS (RESULT SCAN FUNCTION) CANNOT BE ACCESSED BY OTHER USERS. IT IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE USER WHO EXECUTED THE QUERY.

* THERE IS NO METADATA ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESULTS, WHICH IS WHY A SMALL DATA SIZE AND ROWS ARE PREFERRED.

* THE DEFAULT PURGE TIME OF 24 HOURS FOR PERSISTED RESULTS CAN BE RESET TO 31 DAYS ONLY IF WE REUSE THE PERSISTED RESULTS. 
  THE END DATE IS CALCULATED FROM THE DATE AND TIME THAT THE QUERY WAS FIRST EXECUTED.

--> QUERIES::
-------------

SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCDS_SF100TCL.STORE_SALES LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCDS_SF100TCL.STORE_SALES WHERE SS_SOLD_DATE_SK='2451223';

SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'USE_CACHED_RESULT';

*******************VERY VERY VERY IMP TOPIC*******************


---->  *******TIME TRAVEL******* ::
-----------------------------------


* SNOWFAKE TIME TRAVEL HELPS US TO ACCESS/RETRIVE THE HISTORICAL DATA(MODIFIED/DROPPED/DELETED), BASICALLY SNOWFLAKE WILL STORE THE DATA IN FORM OF VERSIONS

	EG::
	 
	 --> WHEN TABLE IS LOADED INITIALLY THE TABLE IS WITH INTIAL SETUP (MICRO-PARTITIONS)  --> THIS IS VERSION 1 
	 
	 --> LATER THERE WAS ANY DML COMMAND WAS FIRED ON THAT TABLE AND DATA HAS BEEN DELETED --> THIS IS VERSION 2
	 
	 --> LATER AT SOME TIME AN JOB IS TRIGGRED AND INSERTED DATA INTO THE TABLE            --> THIS IS VERSION 3


* HERE WE CAN GO BACK TO VERSION 1 OF TABLE SNAPSHOT USING TIME TRAVEL FEATURE IN SNOWFLAKE USING (AT / BEFORE IN SQL)


--> ADVANTAGES::
----------------

* OBJECTS CAN BE RESTORED WHICH WERE DELETED OR DROPPED

* DATA ANALYZATION DURING PERIODS OF TIME

* DATA DUPLICATION IF NEED AT PARTICULAR PERIODS OF TIME


--> TIME TRAVEL SQL CONSTRUCTS::
--------------------------------

* AT / BEFORE IN SQL FOR OBJECT RETRIEVAL / ACCESS

* CLONE COMMAND FOR DATA / OBJECT RESTORATION

* SQL PARAMETERS – TIMESTAMP, OFFSET, STATEMENT

* UNDROP COMMAND FOR TABLES, SCHEMAS, AND DATABASES.


--> DATA RETENTION PERIOD::
----------------------------

* THE STANDARD RETENTION PERIOD IS 1 DAY / 24 HOURS

* RETENTION PERIOD CAN BE SET TO 0 ON ACCOUNT AND OBJECT LEVEL (DATABASE, SCHEMA, TABLE) – TT DISABLED

* ENTERPRISE EDITION AND HIGHER – DATA RETENTION PERIOD CAN BE SET TO 0-90

* THE STANDARD RETENTION PERIOD IS 1 DAY (24 HOURS) AND IS AUTOMATICALLY ENABLED FOR ALL SNOWFLAKE ACCOUNTS:

* FOR SNOWFLAKE STANDARD EDITION, THE RETENTION PERIOD CAN BE SET TO 0 (OR UNSET BACK TO THE DEFAULT OF 1 DAY) AT THE ACCOUNT AND OBJECT LEVEL (I.E. DATABASES, SCHEMAS, AND TABLES).

* A RETENTION PERIOD OF 0 DAYS FOR AN OBJECT EFFECTIVELY DISABLES TIME TRAVEL FOR THE OBJECT.

* FOR SNOWFLAKE ENTERPRISE EDITION (AND HIGHER):

	--> FOR TRANSIENT DATABASES, SCHEMAS, AND TABLES, THE RETENTION PERIOD CAN BE SET TO 0 (OR UNSET BACK TO THE DEFAULT OF 1 DAY). 
	    THE SAME IS ALSO TRUE FOR TEMPORARY TABLES.
		
	--> FOR PERMANENT DATABASES, SCHEMAS, AND TABLES, THE RETENTION PERIOD CAN BE SET TO ANY VALUE FROM 0 UP TO 90 DAYS.
	
* WHEN THE RETENTION PERIOD ENDS FOR AN OBJECT, THE HISTORICAL DATA IS MOVED INTO SNOWFLAKE FAIL-SAFE:

	--> HISTORICAL DATA IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR QUERYING.
	
	--> PAST OBJECTS CAN NO LONGER BE CLONED.
	
	--> PAST OBJECTS THAT WERE DROPPED CAN NO LONGER BE RESTORED.
	
* TO SPECIFY THE DATA RETENTION PERIOD FOR TIME TRAVEL:

	--> THE DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS OBJECT PARAMETER CAN BE USED BY USERS WITH THE ACCOUNTADMIN ROLE TO SET THE DEFAULT RETENTION PERIOD FOR YOUR ACCOUNT.
	
	--> THE SAME PARAMETER CAN BE USED TO EXPLICITLY OVERRIDE THE DEFAULT WHEN CREATING A DATABASE, SCHEMA, AND INDIVIDUAL TABLE.
	
	--> THE DATA RETENTION PERIOD FOR A DATABASE, SCHEMA, OR TABLE CAN BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME.

====================================================================================================================

---> ****FAIL SAFE**** ::
------------------------

* FAIL-SAFE OFFERS PROTECTION OF DATA IN CASE OF DISASTER OR SYSTEM CRASHES, MANAGES 7 DAYS OF DATA BY SNOWFLAKE.

* IF AWS CRASHES THEN THE SNOWFLAKE WILL RECOVER ALL THE DATA FROM FAIL-SAFE,

* BASICALLY THE FAIL SAFE WILL HAVE THE LAEST COPY OF THE DATA AFTER 24 HRS AND THEN NEW SNAPSHOT WILL BE REPLACED.

* 

--> ADVANTAGES::
-----------------

* FAIL-SAFE PROVIDES A (NON-CONFIGURABLE) 7-DAY PERIOD DURING WHICH HISTORICAL DATA IS RECOVERABLE BY SNOWFLAKE.

* FAIL-SAFE IS NOT PROVIDED AS A MEANS FOR ACCESSING HISTORICAL DATA AFTER THE TIME TRAVEL RETENTION PERIOD HAS ENDED. 

* IT IS FOR USE ONLY BY SNOWFLAKE TO RECOVER DATA THAT MAY HAVE BEEN LOST OR DAMAGED DUE TO EXTREME OPERATIONAL FAILURES


--> WHY FAIL SAFE INSTEAD OF BACK-UP::
-------------------------------------

* DATA CORRUPTION OR LOSS CAN HAPPEN WITH ANY DATABASE MANAGEMENT :

	--> FULL AND INCREMENTAL BACKUPS
	--> TIME REQUIRED TO RELOAD LOST DATA.
	--> BUSINESS DOWNTIME DURING RECOVERY.
	--> LOSS OF DATA SINCE THE LAST BACKUP.
	
* SNOWFLAKE’S MULTI-DATA CENTER, REDUNDANT ARCHITECTURE GREATLY REDUCES THE NEED FOR TRADITIONAL BACKUP. 

* FAIL-SAFE PROVIDES AN EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO BACKUP THAT ELIMINATES THE REMAINING RISK 

====================================================================================================================

****SNOWFLAKE CLONNING****::
--------------------------------

---> CLONNING -OR- ZERO-COPY CLONNING (TERM ZERO IS PREFIXED ,AS THERE IS NO COST ASSOCIATED WHILE CLONING ::
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* CLONNING IS A MAKING COPY OF DB OBJECTS IN SNOWFLAKE.

* IF A CLONE A TABLE/DATABASE THERE WILL NOT BE AN ADDITIONAL STORAGE CHARGES.

* THE BOTH SOURCE AND CLONNED OBJECTS ACTS INDIPENDENTLY AND UPDATES/MODIFICATIONS WILL NOT REFLECTS IN EITHER OF CASES.

* WHERE AS THE MICRIPARTIONS WILL BE SHARED BETWEEN SOURCE AND CLONE.
  IF NEW DATA COMES IN THERE NEW PARTIITIONS WILL BE CREATED IN REPECTIVE END'S AND SNOWFLAKE MERGES IT AND DISPLAY'S THE RESULT 

* CLONNIG WILL/CAN BE DONE ON SAME ACCOUNT, IT CANNOT BE DONE ON TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS (EG:: BETWEEN PROD , DEV CLONNING CANNOT BE DONE ON BETWEEN THESE)

* IT ALSO CALLED A ZERO COPY CLONNING ( CLONNING IS NOT A COMPLETE 1 TO 1 COPY IT IS SAME AS SHARING)

* CLONNING A DATABASE IT CLONES ALL THE SCHEMAS,TABLES WITHIN DB

* CLONNING A SCHEMA IT WILL CLONE ONLY TABLES 


---> ACCESS CONTROL PRIVILEGES FOR CLONNED OBJECTS::
----------------------------------------------------

* CLONES DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE SAME PRIVILAGES AS THIER SOURCE, SIMPLY THE PRIVILAGES ARE NOT CARRY FORWARDED IT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED EXPLICITLY.

* SINCE THE GRANTS ARE PROVIDED ON SNOWFLAKE IS ROLE BASED THE GRANTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED ON CLONNED OBJECTS TO USERS IN ORDER TO ACCESS  

* CLONE REPLICATES ALL GRANTED PRIVILAGES ON CORESSPONDING CHILD OBJECTS:

	--> IF CLONNED DB'S, CONTAINED OBJECTS INCLUDES SCHEMAS,TABLES,VIEWS ETC...
	
	--> FOR SCHEMAS, CONTAINED OBJECTS INCLUDES SCHEMAS,TABLES,VIEWS ETC...


---> CLONNING LIMITATIONS IN SNOWFLAKE::
---------------------------------------

-->	CLONNING STAGES::
---------------------

	* IF SCHEMA IS CLONNED THEN ONLY EXTERNAL STAGES ARE CLONNED , NAMED INTERNAL STAGES WILL NOT BE CLONNED TO NEW CLONNED SCHEMA.(**IMP**)
	
	* TABLES STAGES AND USER STAGES ASLO NOT BE CLONNED TO NEW SCHEMA
	
	
--> CLONNING PIPE::
-------------------
	
	*  WHEN A DB OR SCHEMA IS CLONED , THEN ANY PIPES IN THE SOURCE CONTAINER THAT REFERRING TO INTERNAL STAGE IS NOT CLONNED.
	   THE PIPE WHICH IS POINTING TO EXTERNAL STAGE IS ONLY CLONNED TO NEW SCHEMA.
	  
    * THERE IS ISSUE IN CLONNING PIPE THE CLONNED PIPE IT WILL HAVE THE DEFINANTION OF ORIGINAL SCHEMA/TABLE IF WE WRITE FULLY QUALIFIED NAME 
	  (PUBLIC.EMP FROM @MY_S3_STAGE) INSTAED OF IT WE SHOULD WRITE ONLY EMP FROM @MY_S3_STAGE, THIS CAN RESULT IN DATA DUPLICATION
		
		EG::
		
		     CREATE OR REPLACE PIPE MY_EMP_PIPE AS
			 COPY INTO EMP FROM @MY_S3_STAGE;
			 

--> CLONNING STREAMS::
----------------------	   
	
	* WHENEVER WE CLONNED A STREAM , THE STREAMS (DEFINANTION) WILL BE CLONNED BUT THE UNCONSUMEND DATA/EXISTING DATA WILL BE NOT CLONNED.

--> CLONNING TASKS::
--------------------
 	
	* WHEN A DB OR SCHEMA IS CLONED WHICH CONTAINS TASKS, THE TASKS ARE CLONNED BUT THOSE ARE SUSPENDED BY DEFAULT
	  WE MUST EXPLICILTY GRANT ANY REQUIRED PRIVILAGES TO NEWLY CREATED CLONE
	  
--> DDL IMPACT::
----------------

	* RENAMING OF OBJECTS IS NOT SUGGESTED WHILE CONNING OPERATION IS HAPPENING FOR A LARGE OBJECT	
	  
--> DML IMPACT::
----------------	  
	  
	* WHILE CLONNING LARGE OBJECTS AND IF ANY DML ACTIVITY IS BEIGN DONE AND THE OBJECTS WHICH HAS DATA_RETENTION_PERIOD=0 WILL FAIL IF THE DATA IS PURGED
	  REFRAIN FROM DML ACTIVITY WHILE CLONNING.

--> CLONNING OF HISTORICAL OBJECT::
----------------------------------	
  
	* IF THE OBJECT DOES NOT EXIST AT THE TIME OF CLONING AN ERROR WILL BE THROWN
		
	* TABLE ALSO CAN BE CLONNED AT PARTICULAR SNAPSHOT OF TIME

--> TABLE ID::
--------------

	* EVERY SNOWFLAKE TABLE HAS AN ID THAT UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES THE TABLE

	* EVERY TABLE IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH AN CLONE_GROUP_ID, IF A TABLE HAS	NO CLONES, THEN ID AND CLONE_GROUP_ID WILL BE EQUAL

	   --> SELECT * FROM PRACTICE.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'EMP';
	   
	   --> SELECT DISTINCT * FROM PRACTICE.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS WHERE ID!=CLONE_GROUP_ID and TABLE_NAME = 'EMP';
